    <h2>Plant Model</h2>
    <p>
        The state variables of the model are the angle of the launcher with respect
        to the horizontal plane, \(\theta\), and the angular velocity of the launcher, \(\omega\).
        The derivative of \(\theta\) is \(\omega\) and  the derivative of \(\omega\) is \(\dfrac{Tl}{I}\sin(\beta)\).
        \(l\) is the distance between the point of application of the thruster force and the center of mass. \(I\)
        is the moment of inertia (lateral axis). \(T\) is the the force generated by the thruster.
        \(l\), \(I\) and \(T\) are the constant parameters of the model.
        \(\beta\) is the input of the model and represents the angle of deflection of the nozzle with respect to the longitudinal axis.
    </p>
    <h2>Sensor Model</h2>
    <p>
        The sensor provides measurements of the angle of the launcher. However the measurements are distorted by
        scale factor \(s\), bias \(b\) and random noise \(\sigma\) effects due to the nature of the sensor.
        The output of the sensor, \(\theta_m\) is computed as \(s\theta + b + w_n\) where \(w_n\) is a random noise of variance \(\sigma\).
    </p>
    <h2>Actuator Model</h2>
    <p>
        The actuator drives the nozle of the launcher using an electric motor. 
        $$
        \ddot{\beta} + 2\zeta_s\omega_s\dot\beta+\omega_{s}^2\beta=\omega_{s}^2\beta_c
        $$
        where \(\beta_c\) is the commanded nozzle angle, \(\omega_{s}\) is the natural frequency
         (the frequency at which the actuator would oscillate if it was not damped) of the actuator and
         the \(\zeta_s\) is the damping ratio.
    </p>
    <h2>Controller Model</h2>
    <p>
        A simple proportional controller is implemented.
        The controller updates the commanded nozzle deflection proportional to the attitude error.
        $$
        \beta_c = K_p(\theta_m - \theta_r)
        $$
        Where \(K_p\) is the proportional constant and \(\theta_r\) is a constant reference/desired attitude.
